# Graph_States_Public


Scripts to simulate stabilizer circuits based on the methods developed by S. Aaronson and D. Gottesman, "Improved simulation of stabilizer circuits", Phys. Rev. A 70, 052328 (2004).

The code has the capability to find the quantum circuit that prepares a photonic graph state from emitters based on the algorithm developed in Ref: B. Li et al., npj Quantum Inf. 8, 11 (2022). Additional optimization levels are provided in this library in order to find optimal resource requirements for preparing the photonic graph states.

Extra functionalities include:

- LC equivalence check of 2 graphs [Recognizing locally equivalent graphs, A. Bouchet, Discrete Mathematics, 14, 75-86 (1993)].

- Generation of LC orbit of a graph G.

- Counting the size of the LC orbit [Recognizing locally equivalent graphs, A. Bouchet, Discrete Mathematics, 14, 75-86 (1993)]

- Recognition of split-free & circle graphs [Reducing prime graphs and recognizing circle graphs, Bouchet, Combinatorica    7, 243-254 (1987)].

- Construction of double-occurence word for circle graphs.

- Evaluation of several graph properties (e.g., chromatic number, edge chromatic number, Lovasz number).
